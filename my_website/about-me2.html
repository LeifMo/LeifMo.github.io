    <p>Who IS Leif Mollo?</p>
    <p>Is he a man?</p>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <p>Is he a great man?</p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>But does that make him any <i>less</i> of a man, to be <i>just</i> a man, rather than a great man?</p>
    <p>Absolutely not.</p>
    <p>Leif Mollo is a man. Well, a young man. A young adult, if you will. The kind that all those books
    are aimed towards. Hunger Games, Divergent, stuff like that. But I'm pretty sure only girls
    read those. Leif hasn't read those. Well, he's read Hunger Games, because it was all the rage, back in middle school,
    but he's never read Divergent. He saw the movie. It was pretty bad.</p>
    <p>Would you like to hear the story of Divergent?</p>

    <p>So Divergent right it's the tale of <s>discount Katniss Everdeen</s> a girl named Tris (<s>More like Kattriss</s>) and she lives in a world
    where everyone chooses which caste they live in. Well, it's not really a caste, since the groups don't really
    have a hierarchy, so I guess it's more like choosing your class in an RPG. </p>
    <img src="images/chooseyourclass.jpg" height="250" width="300" alt="here should be a meme">
    <p>Like this old meme, you know? So anyway, there are several classes. Like you can be a farmer, which is pretty
    useful to a dystopian society (Divergent takes place in a dystopian society, by the way, surprise surprise, Young Adult genre).
    You can be a scholar or whatever, which is pretty productive, since basically that means you work in politics and stuff
    (but oh no... this is dystopian Young Adult Novel... the government is gonna be comically corrupt, isn't it?). Or, you could run on stuff.
    Yeah, one of the classes is called "Dauntless." Essentially, they're a bunch of pretty teenagers who run around, whoop, and holler. I'm pretty sure they
    were all teenagers. Like, not a single adult was there. What does Dauntless do? We're told that they're law enforcement, but it's very easy to forget because most of the time
    it's just the dauntless kids running around, doing cool parkour, and jumping on trains. As training excersises. The only time they do any enforcing is at the end
    when the government takes control of their minds, but I'll get to that later. So anyway, Not Katniss, as no one could possibly expect, joins
    Dauntless, because she represents wish fulfillment for the reader, and every teenager's wish is to run around on trains with a bunch of pretty people and to be socially accepted.</p>
  <figure>
      <img src="images/dauntless.jpg" height="250" width="300" alt="Here should be a picture of Dauntless.">
      <figcaption>Here, Tris is told to take a leap of faith to prove her loyalty to Dauntless. Yes, it's just as lame and dumb as it looks.</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <p>And speaking of pretty people, we meet our male lead, Four! He's dark and brooding, but it's because he's BYRONIC 
    and he has a DARK and TROUBLED past. Also, to the surprise of no one, he immediately falls in love with Discount Katniss because...
    she's the main character, I guess. I mean, no offense to Shailene Woodley, she's good looking enough, I guess, 
    you kinda have to be if you're an actress, but Not!Katniss's best friend is played by ZoÃ« Kravitz, who's far more attractive than her. But maybe that's just me.
    </p>
  <figure>
    <img src="images/four.jpg" alt="Picture of Four">
    <figcaption>This is Four</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <p>Anyway, it's later revealed that Four's real name is Tobias, and he named himself Four because of his four fears or whatever. Tobias is a cool name, though. You know how in Tangled Flynn Rider's real name was Eugene?
    And he used the name "Flynn Rider" in order to give himself a heightened sense of importance and self worth because he didn't like his true self and wanted to be someone else? And it was accepting his real name was a major part of his character arc? Four uses a different name because... it's cool and it'll make the teens reading this cry, or something. Now, I'm not saying Tangled is better than Divergent, but... actually, it kinda is. But this isn't about Tangled, this is about Divergent. 
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, the rest of the movie is pretty boring. Characters die, but you're never really attached to them. None of them were particularly well written or likeable. Government was evil, surprise surprise, and not that interesting. The actors gave pretty wooden performances. I enjoyed laughing at the movie and making fun of it
    with my friends more than I did the actual movie. Overall, 4/10. It had decent production value enough, I suppose. It wasn't <i>terrible</i>. Just <i>very</i> mediocre and soulless. I would say they tried, but I'm not sure if they did.
    <p><font color="white">plot twist</font></p>
    <p>Actually, I am sure they tried. Because the production company, like most companies when it comes to these kinds of movies, tried to stretch out their franchise like a rubber ballerina.
    No one saw the second movie. And no one saw the third movie. This led to the company behind the movie, Lionsgate, to announce that <i>there would not be a fourth theatrical movie; instead it would be a 
    direct to television movie</i>. Shailene dropped out of her leading role. Overall, it was a very funny series of events.</p>
    <p><font color="white">Nice</font></p>
    <p>Anyway, </p>
    <p><font color="white">Nice</font></p>

    <p>So one day, Leif Mollo enrolled in an AP Computer Science Principles Class</p>

    <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/174435112/">Which he did</a></a></p>
    <p>Then he was asked to make a Scratch game.</p>
